points of leverage:
_layouts directory

don't change anything in _sites because this is overwritten in each build

# liquid objects

{{ site.title }} outputs variable of that name

# liquid tags

for logic:
{% if page.show_sidebar %}
	<html code>
{% endif %}

also: unless, elsif / else, case/when


# liquid filters

change output of liquid objects:

{{ "hi" | capitalize }}

for numbers: abs, at_least, at_most, ceil, floor, ...
for text: append, concat, downcase, escape, ...

{{ site.time | date_to_xmlschema }}

{{ site.time | date_to_long_string: "ordinal" }}

{{ page.content | number_of_words }}

{{ page.tags | array_to_sentence_string }}


{{ page.tags | array_to_sentence_string: "or" }}

# Front matter

top of the file separated by triple-dashes, to set variables for the page
---
my_number: 5
---

then in page using liquid: {{ page.my_number }}

a minimal front matter:
---
---
is NECESSARY for liquid tags to be processed


# Debugging

check in _site directory what was built

# Start

> bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
